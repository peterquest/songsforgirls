Cheers to the original. The reason this lists exists is because I turned this on when Goldie was in her carseat crying her lungs out and she immediately ceased her sobbing and just sat there listening pensively. It consistently worked to calm her or otherwise put her in a happy mood. What a godsend for a new parent! The simplicity of the opening piano seems to be the perfect lure for the mind of a child.
