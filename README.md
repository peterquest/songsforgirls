A running list of songs my girls like. This could probably also be considered a list of "Good songs that are also functional kid's songs."


### A.M. 180 - Grandaddy

### Painter in your Pocket - Destroyer

### Fish and Whistle - John Prine

### Wait until the mornin' comes - Neil Young

### Only love can break your heart - Neil Young

### Ghost Town - The Specials

## 2022

### Round the Christmas Tree - Gene Autry

Ok yeah it's a Christmas song. But if you're going to have your kids latch on to a xmas song and have to listen to it on repeat it could be a lot worse than this one.

### Too Many Birds - Bill Callahan

`birds + bird + bird + birds + bird + bird + bird = too many` is funny

### [goin' on a plane today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asfLDrLrEvk) - Kurt Vile
Cheers to the original. The reason this lists exists is because I turned this on when Goldie was in her carseat crying her lungs out and she immediately ceased her sobbing and just sat there listening pensively. It consistently worked to calm her or otherwise put her in a happy mood. What a godsend for a new parent! The simplicity of the opening piano seems to be the perfect lure for the mind of a child.
